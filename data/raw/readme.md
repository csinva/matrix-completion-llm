# This is a folder for raw data.

Along with each dataset, we need to keep track of a few things:
- data source
- task-specific
  - outcome variable name
  - task type (e.g. binary/multi-class classification, regression, outlier detection etc.)
- variable types (e.g. categorical, ordinal, datetime, string, etc.)
